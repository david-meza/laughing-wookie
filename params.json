My contact information can be found at the bottom of my website.\r\n\r\nA little bit about myself...\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n\r\nI am truly passionate about software engineering. I love learning new programming languages and frameworks and can be a strong asset to any company as a part of their development team\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nI have always been fascinated by technology. From a very early age (since elementary school), I've been looking for ways to build cool things in a logical way. I remember I started with using Turbo Pascal with Turtle graphics, doing simple things like drawing a house, then as time progressed I moved forward into more complex things. I attended college and graduated with a major in MIS, and during that time I supplemented my studies with online courses on programming. Not being satisfied with the results of my education, shortly after graduation I decided to attend Viking Code School to teach me more about professional software engineering. It was hard, it was challenging, and now I feel I'm prepared for the next step in my dream career. \r\n\r\nMy Recent Projects\r\n\r\nI am most familiar working with Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL in the back end, and HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript in the front end. Some frameworks and libraries that I use include Bootstrap, and jQuery. Other supporting practices I use are Github for version control, Heroku for app deployment in a cloud platform, and Sass pre-processor for stylesheets. I've recently worked in Danebook, which is a Facebook clone that mimics the user experience of a social media website.\r\n\r\nWho I am and what I'm looking for\r\n\r\nI have a strong desire to grow as a programmer. I am always striving to commit better code, and I want to work for a company that expects that of me. While I would be most comfortable to work at a place which employs the technologies I am familiar with, I pick up languages and frameworks quickly and would be happy to acquire new skills and knowledge. I am interested in both backend, and full-stack positions, particularly when they deal with things like big data, data visualization, and data science.\r\n","google":"UA-66662228-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
