<p>A little bit about myself...</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>I am truly passionate about software engineering. I love learning new programming languages and frameworks and can be a strong asset to any company as a part of their development team</p>

<p>Background</p>

<p>I have always been fascinated by technology. From a very early age (since elementary school), I've been looking for ways to build cool things in a logical way. I remember I started with using Turbo Pascal with Turtle graphics, doing simple things like drawing a house, then as time progressed I moved forward into more complex things. I attended college and graduated with a major in MIS, and during that time I supplemented my studies with online courses on programming. Not being satisfied with the results of my education, shortly after graduation I decided to attend Viking Code School to teach me more about professional software engineering. It was hard, it was challenging, and now I feel I'm prepared for the next step in my dream career. </p>

<p>My Recent Projects</p>

<p>I am most familiar working with Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL in the back end, and HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript in the front end. Some frameworks and libraries that I use include Bootstrap, and jQuery. Other supporting practices I use are Github for version control, Heroku for app deployment in a cloud platform, and Sass pre-processor for stylesheets. I've recently worked in Danebook, which is a Facebook clone that mimics the user experience of a social media website.</p>

<p>Who I am and what I'm looking for</p>

<p>I have a strong desire to grow as a programmer. I am always striving to commit better code, and I want to work for a company that expects that of me. While I would be most comfortable to work at a place which employs the technologies I am familiar with, I pick up languages and frameworks quickly and would be happy to acquire new skills and knowledge. I am interested in both backend, and full-stack positions, particularly when they deal with things like big data, data visualization, and data science.</p>
